# Mario Party 6 Blue Toad Mod
Changes the regular Red Toad to a Blue Toad, kind of like how Super Mario 3D World uses Blue Toad instead of Red Toad.

# Installation
Place the folder 'GP6E01' in '%userprofile%\Documents\Dolphin Emulator\Load\Textures\'
Also make sure to go to 'Graphics Configuration' in Dolphin Emulator,  and under the advanced tab, enable 'Load Custom Textures' and 'Prefetch Custom Textures'
